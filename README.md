# Final oop 2 Project

This is a final project for the object oriented programming course at the federal university of uberlandia - UFU.

In this project we build a remaster of [freeway](https://www.atari2600.com.br/Atari/Roms/01DH/Freeway), the game of chicken. But we put a touch more, we integrated our game with a generative artificial intelligence that is the fad of today.

### Where does ia come into this game? 

Every time the chicken collides with the car we will give you a second chance before resetting your points, this second chance consists of a question related to the programming universe and 4 alternatives. This is where the AI comes in, the question and the alternatives are all generated by the GPT chat through an integration with the open ai api.

> To curious people, this was the prompt we used to generate the questions
```
"Gere uma pergunta técnica sobre o universo da programação, onde temos uma pergunta e 4 respostas onde apenas uma está correta, o resto tem alguns erros não tão evidentes, mas tem erros. A pergunta possui no máximo 100 caracteres e cada resposta no máximo 30 caracteres. Dê o JSON nesse formato { \"question\":  String, \"answers\": String[], \"correct_answer\": number}"
```

### Main concepts explored

In the OOP course we had to build this project to show our knowledge in design patterns and persistence data.

3 patterns were used:
- Observer
- Builder
- Strategy

For persistence we use:
- MySQL
